# 2018 University of New Brunswick Programming Competition
---
This repo is a compilation of the problems and their solutions from the 2018 programming competition put on by the University of New Brunswick.</br>

I am doing this as practice for this years programming competition. Last year I wrote all my code in C so this year I have decided to mix things up and complete the competition using Python v3.4. I have not written python in a while so this should be interesting.</br>

Each folder above will be labeled 'Challenge #' and within each folder will be a README explaining the challenge, the input file used to test my code, as well as my coded solution in Python.</br>

Wish me luck</br>
